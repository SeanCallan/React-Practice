# React Practice

I am using this repo for several small React apps I built in the summer of 2018 while learning React. I will include a table of contents as the list of projects grows, and details on each project will be available in their respective folders within this repo.

Feel free to contact me with any feedback, I am always open to working with others and learning from new perspectives! I can be reached at joshua@hunschejones.com.
